<h1> Come to my half birthday party! </h1>

<p> Birthdays are like Lord of the Ring trilogy movie marathons, you go have one every six months! So let me cordially invite you to this summer's main event..
	<p/>

<h2> My half-birthday party! </h2>

<p/> That's right. You only turn 33 and a half once. So put on your party hat and dancing shoes cuz I'm rolling out the red carpet for <i> YOU! </i> and a plus one. Or a plus two. Or a plus a billion! Bring all your friends! Everyone is going to be there! We're going to Timmyâ€™s for skis with Judge, Tom, P.J., Bernie, and Squi. Put it on your calendar now!</p>

<h2> Cool, Greg, but what's on the Docket? </h2>
